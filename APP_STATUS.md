# Application Status Review

- Date: 2024-05-28T14:45:00+07:00
- Environment: Containerized Linux (Flutter SDK not installed inside this workspace)

## Toolchain Snapshot
- Flutter/Dart: Locked to 3.3.8 / 2.18.x via `.fvmrc` (install with `fvm install 3.3.8` on host; command unavailable here).
- Xcode: Not installed in container (required on macOS runners only).
- JDK: OpenJDK 21.0.2 available in container for Gradle tasks.
- AGP: 7.4.2 as declared in `android/build.gradle`.
- Gradle: Wrapper pinned to 7.6.3 (`android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`).
- Pods: Not installed (run `pod install` on macOS before iOS builds).

## Summary
Source now guards storage permissions and platform-dependent IO before dispatching files, injects configuration through `.env`, and exposes sample signing templates for Android/iOS/Windows. Responsive home layouts render correctly on mobile and desktop, and GitHub Actions matrices cover debug and release builds for Android, iOS, and Windows.

## Pending Steps to Confirm Functionality
1. Install Flutter 3.3.8 via FVM on development hosts (Linux/macOS/Windows as appropriate).
2. Run `fvm flutter pub get`, `fvm flutter analyze`, and `fvm flutter test` locally or through GitHub Actions to confirm analyzer/tests pass with a real SDK.
3. Execute debug builds per platform:
   - Android: `fvm flutter build apk --debug`
   - iOS (macOS only): `fvm flutter build ios --debug --no-codesign`
   - Windows: `flutter build windows --debug`
4. Perform the manual QA script in `docs/manual_test_plan.md` on physical devices/emulators to exercise picker → encrypt/decrypt → result flows on Android/iOS/Windows.
5. Populate required secrets and dispatch the release workflow when ready for tagged artifacts.

## Notes
- GitHub Actions `debug.yml` triggers on pushes/PRs targeting `main` and publishes debug artifacts for all three target platforms.
- GitHub Actions `release.yml` remains available for manual dispatch or semantic tags once signing secrets are supplied.
- Until Flutter and platform-specific toolchains are installed, runtime behaviour cannot be validated inside this container.
