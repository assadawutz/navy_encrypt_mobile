# Application Status Review

- Date: 2025-10-27T07:03:22Z
- Environment: Containerized Linux (no Flutter SDK installed)

## Toolchain Snapshot
- Flutter/Dart: Not installed (flutter --version → command not found on this host).
- Xcode: Not installed (xcodebuild -version → command not found on this host).
- JDK: Available (java -version reports OpenJDK 21.0.2).
- AGP: 7.4.2 as declared in android/build.gradle.
- Gradle: Wrapper configured for 7.6.3 (android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties).
- Pods: Not installed (pod --version → command not found on this host).

## Summary
The current container environment lacks the Flutter SDK, so automated analysis, tests, and builds cannot be executed here to verify runtime functionality of the app.

## Pending Steps to Confirm Functionality
1. Install Flutter 3.3.8 via the provided FVM helper (./fix-fvm.sh --auto) on a macOS or Linux host with GUI support.
2. Run tools/run-all-checks.sh without skip flags to execute analyze, test, and build steps across platforms.
3. On macOS, ensure CocoaPods dependencies are installed and execute the iOS build to produce an IPA for manual smoke testing.
4. Perform manual QA on target devices/emulators to verify runtime behavior.

## Notes
- GitHub Actions workflow ci.yml is configured to build Android and iOS artifacts without code signing. Review workflow runs to confirm latest status once Flutter tooling is available.
- The helper script accepts SKIP_* flags (e.g., SKIP_TESTS=1, SKIP_WEB_BUILD=1) when specific stages must be bypassed temporarily during environment bring-up.
- Until the Flutter toolchain is available, the application runtime state cannot be confirmed from this environment.
