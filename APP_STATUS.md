# Application Status Review

- Date: 2025-10-27T14:16:49Z
- Environment: Containerized Linux (no Flutter SDK installed)

## Toolchain Snapshot
- Flutter/Dart: Locked to 3.3.8 / 2.18.x via `.fvmrc` (install with `fvm install 3.3.8` on host; command unavailable here).
- Xcode: Not installed in container (required on macOS runners only).
- JDK: OpenJDK 21.0.2 available in container for Gradle tasks.
- AGP: 7.4.2 as declared in `android/build.gradle`.
- Gradle: Wrapper pinned to 7.6.3 (`android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`).
- Pods: Not installed (run `pod install` on macOS before iOS builds).

## Summary
Source now guards storage permissions and platform-dependent IO before dispatching files, injects configuration through `.env`, and exposes sample signing templates for Android/iOS/Windows. Responsive home layouts render correctly on mobile and desktop, and GitHub Actions matrices cover debug and release builds for Android, iOS, and Windows.

## Pending Steps to Confirm Functionality
1. Install Flutter 3.3.8 via FVM on development hosts (Linux/macOS/Windows as appropriate).
2. Run `fvm flutter pub get`, `fvm flutter analyze`, and `fvm flutter test` locally or through GitHub Actions to confirm analyzer/tests pass with a real SDK.
3. Execute debug builds per platform:
   - Android: `fvm flutter build apk --debug`
   - iOS (macOS only): `fvm flutter build ios --debug --no-codesign`
   - Windows: `flutter build windows --debug`
4. Perform the manual QA script in `docs/manual_test_plan.md` on physical devices/emulators to exercise picker → encrypt/decrypt → result flows on Android/iOS/Windows.
5. Populate required secrets and dispatch the release workflow when ready for tagged artifacts.

## Notes
- GitHub Actions now exposes two maintained workflows: `debug.yml` (push/PR on `main`, builds Android/iOS/Windows debug artifacts) and `release.yml` (push/tag on `main`, produces signed release artifacts when secrets exist). Verify their latest runs once Flutter tooling is available locally.
- The helper script accepts SKIP_* flags (e.g., SKIP_TESTS=1, SKIP_WEB_BUILD=1) when specific stages must be bypassed temporarily during environment bring-up.
- Until the Flutter toolchain is available, the application runtime state cannot be confirmed from this environment.
