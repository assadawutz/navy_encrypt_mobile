# Build Verification Report

## Environment Summary
- Container OS: Ubuntu (Docker)
- Flutter SDK: Not installed (flutter command unavailable)
- Dart SDK: Not installed (dart command unavailable)
- Android Gradle Wrapper: Missing (`android/gradlew` absent)
- Xcode: Not available (macOS tooling absent)
- Windows build tooling: Not available (PowerShell/Inno Setup absent)

## Attempted Commands and Outcomes
1. `flutter --version` → ❌ `command not found`
2. `fvm --version` → ❌ `command not found`
3. `dart --version` → ❌ `command not found`
4. `./android/gradlew assembleRelease` → ❌ `No such file or directory`

## Blocking Issues
- Flutter toolchain is not present in the container, preventing any `flutter build` invocations.
- Dart SDK is missing, so even `flutter analyze` / `flutter test` cannot run.
- Android release build cannot proceed because the Gradle wrapper script is not committed.
- iOS and Windows builds require platform-specific tooling that is unavailable in this environment.

## Recommendations
- Install Flutter 3.3.8 via FVM (as documented in `README.md`) before rerunning the build matrix.
- Commit the Android Gradle wrapper (`gradlew` and supporting files) or document the expected bootstrap steps.
- Execute platform builds on their respective operating systems (macOS for iOS, Windows for Windows desktop) or use CI workflows defined in `.github/workflows/`.
